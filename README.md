In order to comprehend sales trends, consumer behavior, and product category performance, this project examines retail sales transaction data. To find significant trends in demand and revenue, the analysis is based on exploratory data analysis (EDA).

### Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Dataset & Data Quality

It is observable that the data set consists of the transactions of the sales of every customer that are categorized based on the type of item sold and the price of the item. Moreover, the data is of high quality as there are no missing values.

### Analysis Performed

- Data loading and initial inspection  
- Data quality checks  
- Datetime conversion for time-based analysis  
- Feature engineering for validation and insights  
- Exploratory data analysis using visualizations  
- Interpretation of sales trends and patterns  

### Key Findings

Different time periods saw fluctuating sales performance levels and attributed to differences in sales, while some months provided the majority of revenue. Product category performance varied among product categories, with products sold in higher quantities generally yielding higher total sales. Customer demographic data showed differences among customer demographics with regard to the types of products purchased.

### Conclusion

By using structured sales data to identify valuable information about a company's business, this project shows how valuable structured data can be. The analysis of sales data was made possible because it was cleaned and formatted correctly, and the outcomes of this project identify key trends associated with both the sale of products and the behaviour of customers.
